# creating my new website

I've never been all that interested in web development, let alone actually working with react and different frameworks like that.

However, after spending some time developing a web utility for me to use as a catch-all todo app (https://justletitout.vercel.app/) I realized it wasn't so scary.

## the idea

The idea was simple: create a minimalistic website that would allow me to contain everything that I had in my previous website, only better.

A few of my inspirations came from the following people:
1. Hanz Nathan "The Goat" Po (https://www.hanzpo.com/)
2. Anthony Zhang (https://anthony-zhang.me/)
3. Fernando Borreti (https://borretti.me/)

With my ideas in place, all I had to do is just make it.

## the stack

The stack is pretty simple. I use a react framework in conjunction with a linker to markdown files where I can write blogs such as this one.

There's no backend obviously and there's cool trasitions made with css

## the results

Just like that, my new website looks clean as hell and more professional than ever.
