# handling adhd as a second year double degree student

If you know me, you know that I have a pretty funky case of ADHD. I'm the type of guy to get completely lost in my head because I'm thinking about how I would design/fold a soft taco tortilla to minimize spillage from the bottom (I still think about this constantly).

With all that being said, here is how I manage being an attention deficit second year managing double degree.

## drugs.

ADHD meds work.

ADHD is a brain chemistry issue so naturally meds are the first line of defence. I remember taking my meds for the first time in grade 12 and studying for 6 hours straight without a break. It felt so cool to finally get stuff done. 

However, meds were only part of the solution. I found that I had unlocked a new level of focus, but without any meaningful system, it was kinda useless.

## memory

Ever wonder how memory works for people with ADHD? It's pretty simple.

If it's short term, it doesn't exist.

I had to figure out a way to maximize my ability to memorize information not just for my schoolwork but also for my personal and social life. But I'm also a fucking nerd who will do anything but the normal thing.

So what I ended up doing is the following:

1. get 8 hours of sleep a day
2. develop a really fucking good visual/auditory memory
3. never make notes

The first point is kinda self explanatory. Good sleep leads to a better cognitive ability which leads to a better memory.

The second point was a result of me learning a couple things about myself:

1. I'm really fucking good at remembering events
2. Remembering what something looks like is easier than remembering a piece of information

How did I use this? I would pay an ungodly amount of focus in class just listening and asking questions. Every time there was something important that the teacher was saying I would do something with my hands or pencil to bookmark it in my mind. This would allow me to remember anything the teacher said in class. I would go into quizzes and recreate the classroom where my lectures happened in my head. From there, I can picture those key moments and recall vital information from what my teacher said. Obviously this is not a strategy for everyone so use sparingly

The third point relates to the second part because making notes often prevent me from truly listening to what the teacher is doing. I think this point is pretty universal for everyone because the value you get from going to class is having the guy who knows the whole course right in front of you. The tradeoff you get from writting half-assed shitty scribble notes on your paper instead of having your full attention on the teacher is not worth it.

## procrastination

Obviously the ADHD procrastination goes away from the meds, but there's still a level of procrastination I get and I fucking hate it.

It's like I know I have/want to do a task, but for some reason I can't get myself to do it. 

The difficulty of the action? The fear of failing? It all makes me freeze.

I'm still working on this, but one thing I will say is that being surrounded by a bunch of productive individuals often helps (shoutout waterloo)

## pomodoro

My absolute favourite way of focusing is by using a psuedo-pomodoro technique that involves different study and break intervals

Here's my current system:

- Lots of focus-heavy work: 3 sessions of 90 minutes work, 15 minute rests
- Lots of small tasks or a small number of focus-heavy tasks: n sessions of 45 minutes work, 15 minutes rest
- a few small tasks: n sessions of 45 minutes work, 10 minutes rest

My sweet spot for working is somewhere between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. 90 minute sessions require a lot of brain and mental power, so you can only really do this for 2-3 sessions a day. However, for smaller, less focus-heavy work I find that using a 45 minute interval with a 15 minute break leads to the most mental resilience for completing the tasks.
